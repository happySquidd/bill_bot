This is a python script that was made to automate tenant billing


It will scrape the important info from bill pdf's, convert and calculate the percentages, create and fill out an excel spreadsheet and create directories with all the files for each tenant

To run the script: download as zip, unzip and run main.exe


It was made to fit a specific creteria with predetermined conditions, which are:

  The naming of the files was made to fit the client needs
  
  The bot was made for a pre determined amount of tenants and specifically for two bill files: one from duke and one from spectrum
  
  The bills are split into 50%, assuming both tenants will pay 50% of both bills combined


Overall this project was fun to make, there are definetely improvements that could make it a more versatile code in the future
